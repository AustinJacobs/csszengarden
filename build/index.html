      <h2>Purpose/Theme</h2>

      <div class="cd-box">
        <p>The purpose of this website is to hone css skills and to change the layout, look, and feel of a website using
          purely CSS.
          We do this by choosing a common theme and then utilizing different colors, fonts, and layouts to create a
          unified website that fits together visually.
          The theme that we have chosen for our CSS Zen Garden website is an ocean and underwater theme.
          We really liked a lot of different aspects of many of the previous submissions, so we decided that we would
          take some ideas from many of them and incorporate them into one site.
          We have ideas to use a few SVG’s for art and for a wave in the background. Depending on how much we can get
          done, we are thinking about using some keyframes to make the wave and other art animate.
          We have added in some fun headings that go along with the ocean and underwater theme. The colors are very
          ocean like, and they help create the feel that you are surrounded by water and sun.
          We feel like as we progress in the project, we will be able to find more ways to incorporate the theme into
          the site. We wanted to use complementary colors and some of the colors we thought of were from the Miami
          Dolphins which, if you didn’t know, are in Florida where this is lots of sunshine and water.
          We also felt like have some simple fonts that were both serif and sans-serif would tie the look together as
          well. Finally, all the art that we have chosen has something to do with the ocean, sun, or water theme. We
          felt like the art would be easily incorporated into the site because they are SVG’s, and we can manipulate
          them if necessary.
          We wanted to use contrasting colors but also stay within the blue, orange, and white colors, so we have played
          with different shades to create the feel.

        <h1>Heading: Montserrat <span></span></h1>
        <p>
          <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Montserrat</a>
          font is an open source san serif designed by
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julieta-ulanovsky-aab2469">Julieta Ulanovsky</a>
          It feels very normal, distinguishable, bold and clear enough to read. Montserrat shines for
          it's geometric simplicity and how it matches with other serif fonts.
